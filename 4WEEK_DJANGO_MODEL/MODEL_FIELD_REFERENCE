####1. FIELD OPTION

- __Following options are all avaialble to all fields!__

- NULL
	- Null allows users to insert empty values.
	- However, it is important to set 'BLANK=TRUE'. It is because __string_based_fields accept ' 'data not as NULL making redundancy in DB.__ 
	- Therefore, you should set BLANK = TRUE. 

- BLANK
	- The difference between NULL and BLANK: NULL is purely data-base related. BLANK is validation-related. 
	- Does validation mean larger than DB?
	
- CHOICES

	- Choices consists of tuples. __(value, human readable name)__
	- The best practice is set choices in the model class, and also define suitable named constant for each value. (which is shown below) 
	- Default form widget turns into 'select-box'. 
```
	YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = (
    ('FR', 'Freshman'),
    ('SO', 'Sophomore'),
    ('JR', 'Junior'),
    ('SR', 'Senior'),
)
```


```
MEDIA_CHOICES = (
    ('Audio', (
            ('vinyl', 'Vinyl'),
            ('cd', 'CD'),
        )
    ),
    ('Video', (
            ('vhs', 'VHS Tape'),
            ('dvd', 'DVD'),
        )
    ),
    ('unknown', 'Unknown'),
)
```
The explanation in the documentation for the above 3-dimensional tuples is really shitty. The first element in the tuples mean the group name of the followings __which will be displayed in the 'admin'.__ So, it does not mean much. 



- EDITABLE

	- If set FALSE, not displayed in admin and modelform. 
	- Modelform is something that reduces redundancy when there are closely related model and form.  
	- The default is TRUE. 
	
- UNIQUE

- UNIQUE_FOR_DATE
	-
